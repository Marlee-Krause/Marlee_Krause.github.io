Hi, I’m Marlee Krause, an award-winning photographer and graphic designer with a growing interest in data analytics and computer science. Soon to be a graduate of Westshore Junior/Senor High School in Melbourne, Fla., I taught myself how to code in order to build this website, as part of my Senior Project. I am president and founder of my school’s Photography Club, and have been internationally recognized for my achievements in Future Problem Solving. I hope to use my creativity, leadership abilities, problem solving skills and computer expertise as a springboard to a future career that will utilize all these interests. I invite you to explore my website and check out some of my work.
